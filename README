This github repository hosts my examples for teaching students how to use a KINECT with Open Frameworks

1 ) /SkeletonBasics-D2D is the MS SDK example modified to send skeleton data out via OSC on port 54321
2 ) /ofxKinectNUI_poseLayout/ is a bit of a beast right now it does several things.
	Allows a user to position the skeleton into "poses" and export them
	Allows a user to read in an exported pose and determing if the pose is being made
	Fires off a simple event system for POSE_START, POSE_RECOGNZIED , and POSE_END
